      <h2>What is <em>A Long Hike</em>?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>A Long Hike</strong> is a survival adventure where every run feels like a brand-new story.
        You and up to six friends arrive on a massive island with just a cart, a few basic supplies, and the
        goal of making it <strong>12 miles</strong> through the wilderness to the checkpoint. The journey won’t be easy — and that’s the point.
      </p>
      <div class="grid three">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🌲 Survive the Wild</h3>
          <p>Forests, rivers, hills, campsites, and buildings re-generate each run and are filled with loot, resources, and surprises. Animals roam; monsters stalk at night or in abandoned structures. Random events keep every mile unpredictable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🔧 Systems-Driven</h3>
          <p>Fire spreads, rain wets logs, food spoils in weather, water must be boiled or filtered, and lightning can set objects ablaze — even shake your camera on impact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🎒 Progress & Mastery</h3>
          <p>Grind safer biomes to earn cash, buy gear, and flex advanced equipment as you take on harsher environments and longer runs.</p>

      <div class="grid two">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Stats That React</h3>
          <p>Hunger, thirst, and body temperature respond to weather, time, and activity. Buckets fill in rain or rivers. Water must be boiled or filtered; let it sit too long on a fire and it evaporates.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Fire & Weather</h3>
          <p>Campfires use rocks and logs; logs get wet in rain. Fire spreads to flammables. Thunderstorms bring rolling clouds and lightning strikes that ignite objects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Cooking & Spoilage</h3>
          <p>Roast meat, grill fish, and forage berries — but food left out in stormy weather will spoil, pushing you to plan meals around the elements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Down but Not Out</h3>
          <p>If you fall, teammates can revive you with medkits, restoring your stats and giving you another shot.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Campfires</h3>
          <p>Place rocks, add logs, light the flame. Fuel runs out if you’re careless; wet logs resist burning until dried.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Cart as a Base</h3>
